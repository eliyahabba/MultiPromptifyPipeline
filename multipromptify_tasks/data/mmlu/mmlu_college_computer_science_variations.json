This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references.

This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the bus would a single processor consume, ignoring delays due to competition from other processors?\nChoices: A. 1/50\nB. 1/27\nC. 1/25\nD. 2/27\nAnswer:\nB. 1/27\n\nQuestion: An integer c is a common divisor of two integers x and y if and only if c is a divisor of x and c is a divisor of y.

It is a sound proof system in the sense that there does not exist a proof of the unsatisfiability of a satisfiable formula of propositional logic.\nII. It is a complete proof system in the sense that there is a proof of unsatisfiability for every unsa tisfiable formula of propositional logic.\nIII.

Information in this node includes (1) the owner of the file, (2) a count of the number of links to the tile, and (3) the disk block numbers of the file. What is a primary drawback to this approach to sharing?\nchoices: A. If the owner modifies the file\nB. another user who does not share will see the changes.\nIf the owner renames the file\nC. other users will not be able to access it.\nIf the owner is allowed to delete a file\nD. dangling links may result.\nIf any user who shares the file appends to it\nE. others who share it will not be able to access the new disk blocks.\nanswer:\nC.
